1. create new_code.js and add refactor code of current file with new way of writing code 
    with async/await and with proper comment of code with proper naming convention.

2. @workspace /explain summarize current file and create readme file
    Summary of current file:
    This JavaScript file processes user data from a local JSON file. For each user, 
    it fetches additional data from an external API, filters and transforms the items 
    (only active items, doubles their value, adds a timestamp, and keeps those with value > 10), 
    and writes the processed results to an output file. The code uses callbacks and Promises 
    for asynchronous operations and handles errors gracefully.
