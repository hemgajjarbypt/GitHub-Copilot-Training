Week 4:- I have a JavaScript utility module named with `week4` with functions:
Please generate a comprehensive test files for relative all week4 files using Jest and React Testing Library (where applicable). 
Requirements:
- Cover normal cases and at least 2 edge cases for each function.
- Use table-driven testing patterns (array of test cases).
- Mock external API calls in `getWeather` using Jest mocks.
- Include assertions for exceptions and invalid input.
- Include descriptive test function names.
- Include comments explaining each test case.
- Ensure the tests are runnable with `npm test` or `yarn test`.
- Aim for 90%+ test coverage.
**Generate a README.md for this module**
   The README should include:
   - **Overview**: What this module is, what problem it solves, and why it exists.
   - **Usage Examples**: Show code snippets demonstrating common usage scenarios.
   - **Key Functions/Classes**: Explain what they do and when to use them.
   - **Edge Cases / Limitations**: Mention any known caveats or assumptions.
